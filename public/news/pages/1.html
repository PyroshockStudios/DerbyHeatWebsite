        <p>
            The Sandstorm is an ultra-lightweight and agile machine built to tear up off-road trails while still being able to make serious gains on asphalt. 
            But its real personality comes from that high-strung inline 4 engine; it loves to be revved out, making its peak power at a screaming 7,400 RPM and 
            demanding you push it all the way to its redline.

        <p>
            This amazing machine has a lot of customisability, from the heart of the engine to the outer shell. It comes with a metallic red colour from the factory,
            however it will look just as great with a plethora of paints! Its sleek and modern look will slice through anybody's ego if they try to go against it,
            and it has room for more, the lights can be changed to look more discrete, the buggy can be lowered or raised depending on how you want to use it, and 
            you can swap out monster tyres to make it even more intimidating!

      <p>
        Since we are making an ambitious game, we need as motivated artists as we have programmers
        and designers! Currently, the sole artist is me (Tristan, a.k.a. ZilverBlade), and because
        of this, we have had a tough time trying to keep artwork up with the development, causing
        constant slowdowns.

        The game has quite envolved art targets, ranging from environment to customisation, but
        currently the most critical art is the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weapons (e.g. Firearms)</li>
        <li>Cars (ranging from small cars to very large, preferrably deformable)</li>
        <li>Props (both destructible and non-destructible)</li>
        <li>Buildings</li>
        <li>Vegetation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are also other artistic aspects that we would love to work on, but are much lower
        priority:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Car liveries/skins (partially being worked on by MakoTheUndead)</li>
        <li>Stickers/badges/decals</li>
        <li>Car interiors (low fidelity, as we will not have an interior camera mode)</li>
        <li>UI/UX (we use RmlUi so if you know HTML/CSS this is a very approachable task!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a result of having to balance many different tasks within Pyroshock Studios, we feasibly
        cannot put as much care into the assets (neither in quality nor quantity) as we would like.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of our models that we have been working on over the past 2 years.</p>

      <p><em>The above models have been made with the aid of the following software:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blender (3D Modelling)</li>
        <li>ArmorPaint (Texturing)</li>
        <li>Paint.NET (Image Manipulation)</li>
        <li>Affinity Designer 2 (Vector Art, Concept Art & Design)</li>
      </ul>
